# Unresolved Language Issues in Leda

Although the Leda language as described in this manual is now reasonably
mature, there remain a few issues that are frequently sources of error
or frustration, and are likely targets for future changes in the
language (or in the next generation multiparadigm language). In this
chapter we will describe the most critical of these issues. (In
addition, the current Leda implementation makes a number of limiting
assumptions, thus supporting only a subset of the language defined in
Chapter [1](#gr0).
This, however, is simply an issue of implementation, and not language
design.)

In reading the following, keep in mind that an overriding design
objective has been to keep the language as simple as possible, but no
simpler. Many issues could be addressed by introducing new *mechanisms*,
and one must always weight the cost (both conceptual and practical)
against the benefits.

## Semantics of Assignment and Parameter Passing

In several places we have described the particular semantics of
assignment and parameter passing in Leda. There seems little chance that
the semantics of assignment will be changed, but there is some
possibility that the technique used in parameter passing can be
modified, particularly if a mechanism for cloning values is introduced
(see
Section [3.9](#w1)).
The principle problem with current parameter passing mechanism is that
it does not prevent pass-by-value parameters from being modified from
within a called procedure. There have been various proposals made to
address this difficulty:

- Make a clone or copy of a value before passing as a by-value
  parameter. (Requires a general cloning facility).

- Make by-value parameters constant, and forbid operations on constant
  values. (Currently, operations on constant values are not forbidden,
  only assignment to constants). This seems too restrictive, as many
  existing programs would then cease to work.

- Somehow characterize which functions are constant preserving and which
  are not, and only allow constant preserving functions to be performed
  on by-value parameters. It is not at all clear, however, how to
  discover which functions preserve constant values, and which do not.

## Modularization Facilities

Currently a Leda program is simply one large file. There are “include”
facilities, of course, so that data structures can be moved from one
application to another, but no mechanism for separate compilation.

## Restricted Scoping

Currently all variables declared within a class scope are accessible
using the dot operator. Good style dictates that such values should
never be modified outside the class functions, but the language does not
enforce this restriction. A proposed change would be to include C++
style modifiers for declarations which would separate those values which
were purely local to a class from those which are permitted to be
modified outside the class.

## Shared and Overridden Data Fields

In an earlier version of Leda it was possible to declare data fields
which were shared by all instances of a class. It was also possible to
override data fields declared in parent classes, in much the same way
that methods are overridden. Both features were little used, and due to
difficulties in syntax or implementation, both have been dropped from
the current version of the language.

## The Subscript operator

It is conventional in programming languages, going back to the days of
Fortran and ALGOL-60, to use braces of some sort to indicate array
subscripts. Should Leda follow this tradition?

- Arrays are currently only weakly part of the “language”, if by this
  one means the syntax recognized by the parser. Instead, arrays are
  simply a data structure that happens to be implemented in the standard
  library. (This is not entirely true, since array literals require a
  special syntax, and thus the parser does need to know about the
  “Array” data type in order to give a type to these literals).

- Is it right to complicate the syntax of the language (by adding array
  expressions) for just a single data structure? Of course, one could
  say that this is not really just for arrays – onE could add
  productions like:

  ```leda
  basicExpression: basicExpression LEFTBRACKET expression-list
  RIGHTBRACKET

  </div>

  and say this is simply a shorthand for the function call

  ```leda
  expression.subscript(arguments);

  </div>

  where the number of expressions must match the number of arguments
  provided for whatever the subscript operator is found in the class of
  the expression. (This would permit users to define their own
  array-like things, such as matrices or dictionaries).

- Presuming one did do something like the previous, what should the
  return type be for the subscript operator? Note that the semantics of
  subscripts are different depending upon whether they appear as the
  target of an assignment or as an expression. There seems to be two
  choices – either have separate operators for these two operations
  (similar to the “at” and “atPut” functions now in use in Leda,
  admittedly copied from Smalltalk), or introduce some mechanism for
  explicitly dealing with references as values (as in C++). Neither of
  these seems particularly appealing.

## Overloaded operators and/or functions

Currently there is only a minimal amount of overloading of function
names permitted in Leda. Multiple copies of operator definitions (plus,
times, “and” and “or” and the like) are permitted at the global scope,
and nowhere else. Types of overloading that are *not* permitted include:

- overloading of other function names at the global scope

- overloading of operators in local scopes (either within classes or
  within functions)

- overloading of other function names in local scopes

The argument for outlawing each of these is the same. That is, that
currently if `bar` is a function in scope `foo`, the expression
`foo.bar` has a single well defined and unambiguous meaning. This is a
value of type function (technically, a closure), and can be assigned to
a variable, passed as an argument, and so on. In fact, all procedure
calls, such as:

```leda
foo.bar(x, y, z)

```

are actually treated in two steps. First, the expression foo.bar is
evaluated, resulting in a closure value. Then this closure is invoked as
a function. Introducing any of the overloadings that are currently not
permitted would destroy this property.

(It is sometimes argued that at least operators should be permitted to
be overloaded in class scopes, since operators are never invoked without
arguments, but this is not true; several places in the book I refer to
expression such as “integer.plus” and expect it to mean the binary
function named plus defined in the class integer. Allowing overloading
would make such an expression ambiguous.)

## Nested Classes

This is probably less an open point, and more simply a bug in the
current language implementation. A glance at the current Leda grammar
will indicate that I had originally intended for classes and functions
to be permitted to be nested arbitrarily – functions within functions,
functions within classes, classes within functions, or classes within
classes. While pondering the question of forward references (see next
section) the following awkward example was discovered:

```leda
class A;

function foo(); begin ... end;

class B of A; ... end;

function bar(); begin ... end; end;

```

That is, within class A a new class B is defined, which subclasses from
A. Now, currently the Leda language has been carefully crafted so that
it can be parsed and compiled in one pass. This being the case, do
instances of B inherit the function foo from class A? what about the
function bar? If an instance of B is assigned to a variable declared as
maintaining an A, can we perform the bar function on the result? There
are a number of technical issues that complicate this (meaning,
subclasses are basically an extension of the parent class, and one can’t
extend something that hasn’t been completely constructed yet). Probably
the most logical thing is to rule out completely the type of construct
shown here.

## Forward References for Classes or Functions

In order versions of the Leda language I separated class definition from
method definition. In the latest revision I have used the BETA idea (in
fact this actually goes all the way back to SIMULA) of just putting
everything together into one big structure. While this greatly
simplified the language description, it did have the disadvantage that
it makes it difficult to write mutually recursive classes.

Consider first the analogy to mutually recursive functions. By mutually
recursive functions I mean that a function A can call function B, which
is some cases can call function A again. Mutually recursive functions
can sometimes (but not always) be handed by nesting, as in

```leda
function A();

function B(); begin ... A(); end;

begin ... B(); ... end;

```

It was the consideration of the analogy to classes that led me to
discover the problem with nested classes described in the previous
section.

Another common way to get around the problem of mutually recursive
functions, when nesting doesn’t work, is to create a variable of type
function, which is later defined:

```leda
var A : function();

function B(); begin ... A(); ... end;

function C(); begin ... B(); ... end;

begin A := C; end;

```

This is a somewhat primitive facility that nevertheless permits
functions to be forward referenced (that is, named before they are
defined). A more general forward reference mechanism for functions could
probably be defined and easily implemented, but I don’t know if the
payoff is worth the effort, because the situation is not that common,
either nesting or the variable trick is usually sufficient, and in any
case neither gives us any hint as to how to handle forward referencing
of mutually recursive classes.

The equivalent to the mutually recursive functions in classes is a class
A which in one of its methods creates and manipulates an instance of
class B, and a class B in which in one of its methods creates and
manipulates an instance of class A. In the old Leda (and in C++, Object
Pascal, and other languages which separate the class definition from the
method definitions) the solution is clear. Give the class definition for
A, followed by the class definition for B, followed by the methods for
A, followed by the methods for B. By the time the methods are seen both
class definitions have been read, so both are known.

## Copies or Clones

A common operation is to make a copy, or clone, of a value. Of course,
it is easy to define a clone method in any *particular* class to do this
operation. What is harder is to try to develop a system-wide function or
method to generalize this.

The most obvious approach would be to have a function defined in class
object, which would thus be inherited by all values. Classes which
wanted to change the meaning of this (such as integers or arrays) could
then easily override the method. But the difficulty with this is the
question – what should be the return type associated with this function?

A similar situation occurs with regards to the problem of “reverse
polymorphism”. That is, taking a value known to be of some superclass,
and trying to discover whether in fact it is an element of a subclass.
In the current Leda this is accomplished in a somewhat clumsy fashion,
through a parameterized function named `typeTest` which is defined as
follows:

```leda
function typeTest \[T : object\] (val : object, aClass : Class)-\>T;
begin if aClass.isInstance(val) then return cfunction
Leda_object_cast(val)-\>T; return NIL; end;

```

What is clumsy about this is that the class name must be both passed as
a type-parameter (which is used by the parser, not during execution) and
as a value parameter (used by the execution of the procedure). But this
seems to be the cost for having the mechanism defined entirely in Leda,
and not handed as a special case by the parser.

But this also means that subclasses can not define their own version of
“typeTest”, as would seemingly be necessary to make an equivalent copy
procedure.

## Enumerated Datatypes

Older versions of the Leda language had enumerated datatypes – differing
from their PASCAL or C cousins only in that they printed using their
symbolic form and could be iterated over using a relation. But the
amount of work needed by the parser and the changes to the grammar and
the run-time system necessitated by the introduction of these features
seems all out of proportion to their utility.

It also seemed to be the case that enumerated datatypes in previous
versions of the language were primitive, and not easily extensible (by
adding new functionality, for example).

In the latest Leda I have found a literal array of strings to be almost
as easy to use, and does not require any new language features.

(A half-way measure might be to introduce symbols, as in Lisp or
Smalltalk. The equivalent to an enumerated datatype would then be a
literal array of symbols, rather than strings).

## User Defined Constructors

In my previous extensive work in Smalltalk and C++ I found that the
large majority of time (perhaps as high as 75%) that constructors were
used, they simply initialized the data fields in the newly generated
object. This is why in Leda this is the default behavior, and doesn’t
require any additional effort on the part of the programmer.
Nevertheless, in the remaining 25% of the time it would be nice to have
more general constructor facilities that could perform actions other
than simply initialization.

I have toyed with a couple of idea. The BETA-like solution would be to
make classes more like functions, as in

```leda
class A(a, b, c : x) of B(a, b); ... begin do initialization here end;

```

This makes the class heading somewhat complicated to look at, (and even
harder to parse – for example the parent field is now an expression, not
a type) but is a nice general mechanism. Unfortunately, it limits one to
a single constructor for every class.

Another possible solution is to permit some sort of special “functions”
to appear within a class, such as is done in C++, where a function with
the same name as the class is treated differently from other functions.
This allows multiple constructors for a single class, but seems in other
respects somewhat less elegant.

## Metaclasses

Are classes objects or not? If the answer is Yes, then what is their
type? This is commonly called metaclass programming, and is somewhat
popular at present. I’ve always had a slight suspicion of metaclass
programming, thinking that the mechanism is far too complex for the
benefits involved. Leda does have class values – see the description of
class object and class Class in the standard library. Every object has a
field of type Class, which is holding the name of the class, its size,
the pointer to its parent class, and methods. (The latter don’t actually
appear in the class description).

Currently only two things are done with this information. The first is
the display of the class name when printing the value – (see “asString”
in class object, which gets the 3rd field in the class object, namely
the name of the class. Note that functions from class Class can’t be
invoked in class object because of the forward referencing problems
alluded to earlier). The second is the loop used in the `typeTest`
function described earlier.

Traditional tasks performed by metaclasses include making new instances
and cloning. The latter is not currently done in Leda, and the former is
done as a built-in operation, not a metaclass task.

## A Type inferencing system

It is somewhat of a pain to be constantly filling in the type arguments
in parameterized functions or classes. It would be nice if the system
could automatically infer this information from a function call, as in
ML or similar languages.
